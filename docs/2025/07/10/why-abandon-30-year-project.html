<h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I started an open-source project in 1996, I am abandoning now.
It was not my first OSS project and certainly not the last one.
It definitely was the one that lasted the longest and that I had the most faith in having an impact on the industry.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The project aimed to create a new approach to document maintenance, and over the years, I developed a few versions of software solutions that supported the idea.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I am not abandoning the idea, though.
I still believe that the philosophy behind how we maintain documents is valid.
It proved itself when I wrote my technical books and several documents.
The last version of the software tool I created supporting this document management approach is the one I partially abandon.
Not the approach to document maintenance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this article I will tell you a bit of the</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>history of these software projects,</p>

<li>
<p>how it worked technically,</p>

<p>how it did not work in the industry, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>why it did not work, and why and how do I abandon this project.</p>

<h2 id="2-program-enhanced-document-a-k-a-pet">2. Program Enhanced Document a.k.a. PET</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="2-1-what-is-pet">2.1. What is PET</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The idea of Program Enhanced Document was to do only one straightforward thing originally: include a code snippet in the documentation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When I wrote the documentation of the ScriptBasic interpreter, I created sample programs.
I wanted to have these sample codes in the documentation along with the output of the programs.
I developed the interpreter, the documentation, and the sample code snippets in parallel.
Sometimes, I changed the language, the implementation, and the interpreter, and it also required changes in some of the sample code.
The change in the sample code also changed the output many times.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After making the code change, I copied the samples and output into the documentation.
It was tedious and error-prone, and after a while, as a developer, I decided that I should not manually perform a task that could be automated with a program.
(Usually, this is the point when the original project is abandoned to start a new one.
Not in this case, but ScriptBasic, which is still in use in some industrial products, was developed further till 2006 approximately.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I developed a small macro language in Perl, which I named Jamal as an acronym for Just Another Macro Language.
It is approximately 300 lines of Perl code that could convert one text file to another, processing the embedded macros in the meantime.
There was a macro that could include a file in the output, so whenever a sample code file or the output changed, the document automatically updated to reflect the changes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It worked.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Over the years, I have developed numerous technical documents, including two books on Java 9 and Java 11, as well as several chapters in other books as a co-author.
Through these works, I realized, step by step, that PET, which I did not call by that name at the time, is a general approach that most technical writers should follow.
It is a general approach that enhances the documentation source, typically in a textual markup format with additional information that can be processed automatically.
The documentation written for humans is redundant.
It is not only formatted but also contains information, which is already documented in the system.
Sometimes information is repeated because you do not want the reader to turn pages or navigate links to re-read a single sentence that may apply to several parts of the document.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The conventional method of managing information in documentation is to copy and paste it from the documented system or other parts of the document.
This increases the redundancy in the document, which is the source of inconsistencies.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>PET, as a document maintenance philosophy, says that anything that can be maintained automatically in a document must be automated.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you document a specific version of a Maven project, for example, do not copy the version number into the documentation.
If you do so, it will remain the old, outdated version long after you have modified and released the documentation of the new version, confusing the readers.
Instead, use some means to reference the version in the <code>pom.xml</code>, which is fortunately a very machine-readable format.
It will automatically update the documentation with the actual version using the proper tooling.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you have a configuration string you can use to tune your application, reference the code where it is defined instead of copying it.
Create unit tests that demonstrate the use of the API and include them automatically in the documentation as code snippets.
Do not copy a text that applies to many parts of the document.
Instead, use some macro facility and reference the macro by name wherever you need that text.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>PET ensures that the document is consistent, with a <em>single source of truth</em>, and that all information that can be updated automatically remains up-to-date.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="2-2-jamal-perl-version">2.2. Jamal, Perl version</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The very first version of a program aiming PET was Jamal, written in Perl.
The original summary page from 1996 is still available at</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://peter.verhas.com/progs/perl/jamal/index.html" class="bare">https://peter.verhas.com/progs/perl/jamal/index.html</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It was used to maintain the documentation of the ScriptBasic interpreter, but also to unify the <code>Makefile</code> for the build.
ScriptBasic is written in C, and the build used <code>make</code>.
Makefiles are known for their system dependence, and thus, compilation requires one for Linux and a separate one for Windows.
Additionally, multiple C compilers were available for the Windows platform, some of which were free, while others required a fee, each with its own specific <code>Makefile</code>.
I wanted to provide ScriptBasic in source, compilable for multiple platforms.
Jamal helped create a single <code>Makefile.jam</code> that could be converted into multiple different makefiles for various operating systems and compilers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I used this implementation over the years, and it also had a few other users.
They used it to maintain web pages.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Perl still exists, although it is a legacy language, so maintaining Jamal in Perl didn&#8217;t seem feasible.
The latest version of the code is available from 2010:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://peter.verhas.com/progs/perl/jamal/jamal.pl-2010-09-13.txt" class="bare">https://peter.verhas.com/progs/perl/jamal/jamal.pl-2010-09-13.txt</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It has built-in macros, user-defined macros, conditionals, and loops.
Essentially, it implemented a complex and powerful templating system.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="2-3-pyama">2.3. Pyama</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When I wrote the first version of my book, I was sure to use something like Jamal.
By this time, however, the Perl version was outdated, and I had not touched the code for several years.
Although I could still run it and use it to maintain the source code of the book, it had a specific shortcoming.
The book primarily focused on source code samples and explaining their behavior.
When editing the file using Jamal, all I saw in the editor was the reference to the file and the specific snipped name, not the code.
I had to keep the code open in a different window in a different viewer.
When reviewing the modifications as the samples developed, I had to navigate a lot to the different snippets and source files.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To overcome this, I developed Pyama using a reverse approach.
The basic operation of Jamal is maintaining a source documentation text and converting it to another text.
You edit one file using the editor, and there is a generated file you never touch.
This separation is a good and safe practical approach, also followed by some code-generating tools.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, it is not like the laws of physics, which even politicians can&#8217;t break.
It is a practical rule and not an absolute.
After all, you cannot say you never modify the source code maintained "manually" by any program.
The editor itself is also a program.
Even <code>vi</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Pyama sees itself as an offline "editor".
You write the commands controlling the editor into the edited file, and Pyama edits the file for you.
For example, it updates the code snippets from their actual location.
Some editors, like IntelliJ, also recognize when an edited file changes on the disk and update the loaded one if there is no conflict.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This way, there is only one file that you edit in two different ways.
The only question is how often you save your file to version control and how much you trust your offline editor not to corrupt the text.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Pyama is available at</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://github.com/verhas/pyama" class="bare">https://github.com/verhas/pyama</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It was updated seven years ago.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unfortunately, the publisher insisted that I edit the book in Microsoft Word, and that rendered the Pyama tool unusable for the first book.
For the second edition, I could use their online WYSIWYG editor using HTML behind the scenes, and I could use some specific scripts and the Chrome debug menu to apply PET.
That is, however, another story.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="2-4-jamal-in-java">2.4. Jamal in Java</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Learning from these Python scripts that converted Markdown to a special version of HTML, the WordPress-based online editor used, and from the project Pyama, I forked off two projects.
One was Java::GECI, a code generation tool that updates your Java source files by inserting generated code into them, and the other was the Java version of Jamal.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It started small by implementing the exact macros that had been there for 15 years in the Perl version.
The Java version was cleaner than the Perl, a language that is known for being a hacker&#8217;s tool.
I split up the project into several modules and started to implement special macros into their own module to keep them separate.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Currently, there are more than 200 macros.
They handle code features, like <code>if</code>, <code>for</code>, defining user-defined macros, or setting and resetting the macro start and end separator strings.
There is a separate module to fetch and format text from source files, as well as from JAR files, JSON, YAML, XML, SQL, and so on.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I also integrated it into Maven as a plugin as well as an extension, Asciidoc preprocessor, and JavaDoc as a preprocessor, and into Microsoft Word.
It also integrates with the Java version of my ScriptBasic interpreter, as well as Groovy, JRuby, and Python, allowing you to include code from those languages within your document.
It even includes a small BASIC interpreter that natively integrates with the macro language, allowing macros defined for text processing to be called programmatically.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>(BTW: do not use the macro extension and do not create your <code>pom.xml</code> files with Jamal macros.
It is not a good idea.
I have learned over the years.
These days, I try a different approach to avoid the XML configuration hell.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It can generate extensive trace output in XML, showing the conversion process from input text to output text in each step.
If that is not enough, you can start it in debug mode and use the React.js debugger front-end to execute the macro processing step-by-step.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="3-jamal-problems">3. Jamal Problems</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although Jamal is an enterprise-grade tool, I am not aware of anyone using it.
On GitHub, it has 63 stars, which is one-tenth of the License3j project&#8217;s 621 stars (as of 2025-07-21).
I cannot know the reason; I can only guess.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I guess that the reason is that it is an enterprise-grade tool.
It has numerous features, and thus it has a significant threshold to overcome before it can be used.
Nobody wants to use all 200 macros, and finding the one or a few you need may be a significant effort.
I have to look up the documentation for some, though I implemented them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If I look at License3j, the most popular project in my repository (nothing to brag about because 621 starts are still close to nothing),
It is a simple library that does one straightforward thing: read and write a proprietary license file format and use public-key cryptography to verify it has not been tampered with.
There were numerous requests and bug reports over the decades.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thus, I guess, Jamal is too complex to start with, even if you want to do program-enhanced text.
But it is not only Jamal.
There is a problem with the whole PET approach, which I will not solve in this article.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="4-pet-problems">4. PET Problems</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Program Enhanced Text is more complex than just writing Markdown or AsciiDoc.
A text document may be incorrect, outdated, even unreadable, or contain inappropriate language, but it never causes a build failure.
Developers already have many things that can break a build; they do not need another one.
They are measured by working code, the number of test failures, and production incidents, rather than documentation accuracy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>License3j offers a feature that some people have needed for decades.
SourceBuddy (<a href="https://github.com/sourcebuddy/sourcebuddy" class="bare">https://github.com/sourcebuddy/sourcebuddy</a>) provides a simple API for compiling Java code at runtime.
Java::GECI creates code for programmatically definable code generators.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These are projects that are more commonly used (more stars) than Jamal.
They all address some features that some developers need.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Developers do not need Program Enhanced Text.
Enterprises do, but enterprises do not select technology.
Developers working for the enterprises do.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to the fact that writing PET documentation is more complex, there is another factor.
Nobody reads the documentation.
And this may be a good thing for PET, I discuss in the next section.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="5-pet-and-llm">5. PET and LLM</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A few months ago, I started to create an object-oriented functional programming language, which I named Turicum.
(<a href="https://github.com/verhas/turicum" class="bare">https://github.com/verhas/turicum</a>)
You can see I have a soft spot for scripting languages since I could get my hands on a copy of the "Dragon Book" in 1987 at TU Delft.
I created a BASIC compiler in z80 on the ZX Sinclair Spectrum (does not exist anymore, source code was lost in the noise of some audio cassette).
I created a programmable assembler (PCMAC).
I created ScriptBasic (twice, in C and in Java), Jamal (twice, in Perl and Java).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I never expected Turicum to be widely used, and it may never be.
I created it to experiment with some features that are not available in any other languages, to see how usable they are.
(I promise, I will not derail there. I may write a separate article about closure reclosing, and uncurrying curried functions.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Being at the age that can be inferred from the date I mentioned above, I tend to forget things.
That is where documentation comes into the picture.
I created the documentation of the language, and from time to time, I had to look up what I wrote about some of the language features I created just a month before.
Sometimes it was a lot of time.
I could not say I did not read the documentation, because I wrote it.
Still, it sometimes took a few minutes to find the right chapter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is the kind of work that LLMs can do for us these days.
I exported the Users' Guide in PDF and added it to the context for ChatGPT.
Then I started to ask questions and tried to experiment: what questions could it answer, and what answers it could not.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The factual text and explanations were generally satisfactory.
Code fragments were not so much.
It hallucinated Python code into the language, though Turicum is far from being a Python clone.
So I asked ChatGPT itself what I should change in the documentation so that it does not hallucinate the syntax that much.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Interestingly, his/her advice worked.
It was suggested to add a BNF to the documentation, so I did.
Next, I asked ChatGPT to solve the eight-queen problem in Turicm, and it did.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With the advent of LLM solutions, it is no longer true that nobody reads the documentation.
It is the LLM that reads the documentation, and the users can ask questions.
There may still be a need for some tutorials and an introduction, but that is more like a video format.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, if your reader is an LLM, then you have to structure and format the document for the LLM.
It means that there is less need for explanatory and glue text.
All you need is a precise reference style description, like an EBNF with some comments in the case of a programming language.
You can maintain it in a separate document, but it will be kept more up-to-date if it is part of your source code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can place the reference documentation into program comments and automatically extract it from the code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is an existing practice that I have used many times, utilizing Jamal&#8217;s snippet functionality.
When a function or functionality has several parameters, I create documentation for the parameters in Asciidoctor format within the source code comments.
Jamal reads the source code, extracts these snippets, formats them with pattern matching and regular expression search and replace operations, and inserts them into the text.
It is more likely to update the EBNF description of a command whenever the syntax of the command changes during development if the EBNF is part of the source code.
If it is in a separate document, then it is easy to forget to update.
Out of sight, out of mind.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because there is less need for explanatory text and more need for reference text to be fed into the LLM, the importance of such documentation fragments increases.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="6-recommended-approach">6. Recommended Approach</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What should you do?
What do I recommend if you want to enjoy the advantages of PET but do not want to start with a heavy weapon like Jamal?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I was playing around with the idea of what I would do if I were not allowed to use Jamal, and still want one feature implemented in PET.
This feature is to hierarchically number chapters, sections, and subsections in a Markdown document.
It is a standard feature in Jamal, but I needed a document to pass to someone who I wanted to go on with the document maintenance, and was not likely to use Jamal.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I came up with the idea to maintain the structure of the document to resemble a JSP or ASP, separating program logic and text, while dropping macros.
Instead of a newly implemented macro language, I decided to use Python.
Well-known, good enough for the purpose.
I vibe-coded with Claude the template handling with a simple prompt, and the result is the 100-line Python code in the repository:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://github.com/verhas/pet" class="bare">https://github.com/verhas/pet</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It mixes text with Python code between <code>{%</code> and <code>%}</code> start and end strings.
The Python code can load classes and functions defined in the directory <code>.pet</code> that you can supply with your document.
Hierarchical counters are very simple 80 lines.
If you need another feature from the 200 different macros that Jamal provides, you can write some scripts in a few minutes or hours, tops.
You do not need to install any software, other than Python, that you probably already have on your machine.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Technical details on how to use this library are described in</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://github.com/verhas/pet/blob/main/README2.md" class="bare">https://github.com/verhas/pet/blob/main/README2.md</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, it is essential that I do not explicitly advocate the use of this library or any other alternative to Jamal.
Use Jamal, if that fits you.
It is there; if you report a bug, I probably will fix it.
Use this library, copying it, modifying it to your needs.
Use something else utilizing Python, Groovy, Ruby, or Rust to your taste.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What I advocate is using Program Enhanced Text (PET) documentation for any technology.</p>

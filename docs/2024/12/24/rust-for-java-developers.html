<h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Rust is a relatively new system programming language with a lot of hypes around it.
Some people love Rust, others hate it, and some do these two at the same time.
There is one thing you must not do: ignore it.
Even if you identify yourself as a Java developer, you should know a little what Rust is.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this article I will summarize what the most important features of Rust from a Java developer&#8217;s point of view.
I will touch only lightly the obvious differences to Java, like natively versus virtual machine compiled.
My focus will be more on the features that are special to Rust and are hard to grasp for a Java developer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is nothing in this article you cannot find somewhere else.
Rust has good documentation, if you know Rust, you will find nothing special here.
Reading this article, however, may save some time to get an overall understanding of what Rust is and why it is important.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="2-disclaimer">2. Disclaimer</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I am a Java developer, and I know Java fairly well, but I am not a Rust expert.
I have never participated in a commercial Rust project.
I have created a simple interpreter skeleton to learn the language, but that is all.
A bit more than a hello world.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="3-low-level-programming-language">3. Low Level Programming Language</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Rust is a low-level programming language.
It is designed to write code for tools, operating systems and typically not for business applications.
From this perspective it is very much like C.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the other hand, the language is fairly abstract.
While C can be considered as a portable readable assembly language, Rust cannot.
Rust has very high-level coding abstractions which all compile to low-level code.
Rust calls it zero-cost abstraction.
Any abstract code has a clear way to translate into machine code, and the developer has the possibility to opt out of the abstraction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In other words, zero-cost abstraction aims to generate as performant code as C providing programming efficiency through abstract coding structures.
In my opinion, Rust fulfills this promise.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="4-compiled">4. Compiled</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Rust is compiled using the LLVM compiler tool.
The generated code is directly executable on the target machine without any supporting run-time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It means you need different versions of the compiled packages for different architectures, and the compile time may be significantly more than in the case of Java.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the other hand, the code starts up fast; there is nothing like the JVM warm-up time.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="5-no-null-pointer">5. No <code>null</code> pointer</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In Rust there is no null pointer.
The language is designed in a way that it is not possible to have a pointer that points to nowhere.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Null pointers have caused a lot of issues in modern programming languages since 1965.
It is called the billion-dollar mistake.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock note">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<div class="title">Note</div>
</td>
<td class="content">
This term was coined by <strong>Tony Hoare</strong>, a British computer scientist who introduced the null reference in 1965 while designing the ALGOL W programming language.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In my opinion, computing power and compiler technology were not ready for languages like Rust to avoid null pointers from the start.
So, I think it was not a mistake per se.
Compiler technology and CPU speed developed by time, so today it is possible to create compilers that can compile languages without null pointers.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock note">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<div class="title">Note</div>
</td>
<td class="content">
At the time Algol was developed, there was another programming language in the works.
It was FORTRAN.
Algol was a high-abstraction language, while FORTRAN focused on practicalities.
FORTRAN still exists and is used in many scientific projects.
Algol, on the other hand, is not widely used.
You may correct me, but I do not know any practical application.
It lives on in the ideas that appear in different other programming languages.
Algol was too early, even permitting null pointers.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Eliminating null pointers and handling them properly is a continuous effort.
Java introduced <code>Optional</code>, Kotlin the <code>?</code> postfix operator.
Rust it is part of the language, and the design is coherent with the other language constructs and the run-time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You will never get a NPE in Rust unless you explicitly escape safety using <code>safe</code> blocks.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="6-preprocessor-macro">6. Preprocessor, Macro</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Rust, similar to C, has a preprocessing step.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A preprocessor is a processing step that transforms some source code to another.
Usually it precedes lexical and syntax analysis.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The C preprocessor works on a character level before the lexical analysis.
This is again something that comes from the early CPU limitations.
With the available CPU power, it was a good choice.
It can be implemented independently of the compiler, executed as a separate process.
The integration on the file level.
The preprocessor reads the source code as a file and writes the preprocessed output to be consumed by the compiler.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Half-century later, we can see that a character level preprocessor can be abused.
There are a lot of examples that use the preprocessor not well.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Rust decided to apply the preprocessor at a different stage in the compilation.
It reads the source code, does lexical analysis, and then starts the macro processing.
The processing is not a separate process.
It is part of the compiler itself.
That way the integration is tighter, there is a higher cohesion between the compiler and the preprocessor.
You define the preprocessing using a "macro" language that works with lexical units instead of characters.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock note">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<div class="title">Note</div>
</td>
<td class="content">
An interesting, and for me personally appealing twist in the preprocessor that it works on lexical trees.
The result of the lexical analysis is a list of tokens.
The syntax analyzer usually works on this list.
Rust inserts an analysis step before it, finding all opening and closing braces, brackets, and so on in pairs.
This is a simple syntax analysis already.
The result is a lexical tree that contains the bracketed syntax elements as nodes.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The use of macros is a powerful tool, helping Rust to push some coding error detection to the compilation phase.
For example, using the <code>print!</code> macro the compiler can detect if the  arguments do not match the formatting string.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The built-in macro language is one of two ways to define macros.
The Rust compiler can start code written in Rust during the preprocessing phase.
That way you can write your preprocessor working on, reading and writing, altering the lexical tree in Rust.
This is somewhat similar to Java annotation processing.
Java annotation processor is started after the syntax analysis, and it is not supposed to modify the abstract syntax tree (AST).</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock note">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<div class="title">Note</div>
</td>
<td class="content">
Lombok does modify the AST, but it does so using non-documented and hence non-guaranteed APIs.
It may not work with a new release of Java or with just any JDK.
A JDK implementing Java in a way incompatible with Lombok is possible and still a valid Java.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I see the modification of the lexical tree problematic.
It opens up the language and makes a way to have different flavors.
For example, at the moment we have Java and Java with Lombok as a flavor.
If the number of flavors gets feral, it may have an adverse effect on the language.</p>

<h2 id="7-object-oriented-programming">7. Object-Oriented Programming</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Rust is not object-oriented but it contains a lot of OOP traits (sic).
OOP is usually characterized as something supporting</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Encapsulation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abstraction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inheritance, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Polymorphism</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="7-1-encapsulation">7.1. Encapsulation</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Encapsulation is the bundling of data (fields) and methods (functions) that operate on the data within a single unit, usually a class, and are controlling access to the data via access modifiers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Rust achieves encapsulation using <code>struct</code> and <code>impl</code> blocks.
A <code>struct</code> can define a data structure, like in C.
The <code>impl</code> block defines methods that can work on that data structure.
This is similar to classes in Java.
If you know modern Java and are familiar with the project Valhalla, you can say a <code>struct</code> is similar to a value object.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="7-2-abstraction">7.2. Abstraction</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Abstraction involves hiding implementation details and exposing only essential functionalities.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Rust has access modifiers, and you can also define traits, which are somewhat similar to Java interfaces.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="7-3-inheritance">7.3. Inheritance</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and behavior from another class.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Rust does not support classical inheritance (where a class extends another class).
Instead, it relies on <strong>composition</strong> and <strong>trait bounds</strong> to achieve similar functionality.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is very similar to how Go approaches the same issue.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="7-4-polymorphism">7.4. Polymorphism</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is the interesting part.
Rust does support polymorphism</p>

{%section Introduction%}

This blog post is a follow-up to the earlier entry on the javax0 blog, which you can find at https://javax0.wordpress.com/[javax0.wordpress.com].
While the previous hosting and technology were satisfactory at the time, changes in circumstances necessitated an update.
In this post, I'll explain why I decided to update the blog's technology and what new technology I'm currently using to create these blog posts.

{%section Problems with WordPress%}

First, I have to state that I am not saying or implying that WordPress would not be an excellent platform.
It is a well-established and a kind of one of its kind, de-facto number-one blogging forum.
The problems are specific to my particular needs for this blog.
These needs may not be specific to my person, but a bit more general: technical blogging.

It is like Opel, Toyota, VW, or any other average, workhorse car type.
Opel is a good car; it runs, is reliable, and is reasonably priced.
However, if I am a farmer and need to plow my fields, I will probably choose a tractor instead.
In this analogy, the farmer is a __technical__ blogger.
Emphasis is on __technical__.
For anybody else: WordPress is an excellent choice.

Let's have a look at the issues that I had.

{%subsection Markup%}

When I write anything, I like to edit some markup.
I can use Word or LibreOffice.
I was using DEC Write in the early 1990-is if you are old enough to know what that is but not too old to forget things and still remember.
Even at that time, I preferred markups, which at that time were TeX and LaTeX.

[NOTE]
====
I even wrote a hyphenation preprocessor for Tex for the Hungarian language, and it became a standard part of some Linux distributions.
Since they installed Linux on  Mars Rovers, sometimes I entertain myself with the idea that some of my code got as far as planet Mars.
Please let me have this fantasy, and do not correct me if I am wrong.
====

We could use other markups, like APT, Markdown, Asciidoc, and many others over the years.
These days two of those are used mainly, Markdown and Asciidoc.
WordPress hosted site supported or still supports Markdown, but I started to prefer Asciidoc for these blogs.
The only problem was that I could not.

{%subsection Code Samples%}

When I write some technical blogs, I include code samples.
I develop the code first, and then I write the article.
That is the principle.

However, the practice is that after I started to write the article, I realized that the code was not perfect.
So I changed the code and copied the relevant part to the article sample displays.
Unless I forget to update some of those after a few iterations.

It was also the case when I wrote my first book, and I have sworn that it will never happen again.

{%subsection Version Control%}

Editing on WordPress works, and you can look at the different versions.
But it is not comparable with the possibilities provided by a Git repository.

{%section The New Blog Technology%}

{%subsection Github Pages and Jekyll%}

The new technology stack for blogging is based on GitHub pages.
It is not unique, and it has support for Jekyll, which is a static blogging engine.
Setting up a Jekyll-based blog is pretty straightforward.
I already had the organization name `javax0` on GitHub.
It only seemed logical to use this as `javax0.github.io` for blogging.
Later I may use the `javax0.com` domain that I also keep.

Installing Jekyll on my MacBook was a bit tricky.
First, I had to install the newest Ruby.
An old version of Ruby comes preinstalled on every macOS.
This old version is not suitable for running Jekyll.
I used brew, but it failed, complaining that I was not on the sudoer list.
It took a while until I realized that, for some reason, two `sudo` programs were installed on my machine.
The brew installer used a different one than what I reached from the command line.
I had to add myself to the other sudoer's list as well.
The last trick was to tweak the `PATH` so Jekyll would use the newest Ruby version.
After that, there was still some problem when I configured Jekyll to run locally and on GitHub.
It was executing some commands following some StackOverflow page suggestions.

Sometimes I had no idea what I was doing.
I can only hope that I did not install malware during the process.
You, AsciiDoc, Jekyll, and other tool developers have all my trust.

I integrated JRuby into Jamal, but I do not program in Ruby.

{%subsection Jekyll Asciidoc Plugin%}

In addition to Jekyll, I also installed the Asciidoc plugin for Jekyll.
Since both Asciidoctor and Jekyll are written in Ruby, it was nothing more than issuing a few commands.

{%subsection Jamal%}

The extra part, which is not a standard Asciidoc-boosted Jekyll installation, is my use of Jamal.
The main reason to use Jamal is to include the code samples in the blog posts, but it does much more than that.

I wrote above that I struggled with maintaining the code samples when writing my books.
I created the pyama tool in Python for the second book I wrote.
It copies the code snippets into the text file that I edited.
Later I developed the snippet module for Jamal, which revolves around this concept.
Keep the source in the code files, have only a reference in the document, and copy it in the CI/CD process.
I hesitated to use Jamal and the snipped module myself for a long time.
It is easier to edit a file showing some code when the code is there a few lines above.
Pyama was copying the code into the edited file.
Jamal does not do that.
Jamal can also do that, but I do not recommend using that feature.
A source file is a source file.

When I created the Asciidoctor Jamal plugin that can plug Jamal functionality into Asciidoctor and delivers Jamal WYSIWYG editing in IntelliJ, the situation changed drastically.
There was no reason more to use something like pyama.

NOTE: Pyama is still available in my GitHub, but there are much better tools for the purpose.

Using Jamal, I can include code snippets and delete or keep some lines by selecting regular expressions or line numbers.
I can number the lines, and I can still use all the Asciidoctor formatting features at the same time.

{%subsection Installing Jamal%}

Installing Jamal to use in IntelliJ is very simple.
All it takes to download a ZIP file and extract the content into the projects `.asciidoctor/lib` directory.
You should open IntelliJ settings and associate the `.jam` extension with the Asciidoctor plugin (in addition to the other default extensions already there).
Restart IntelliJ, and you can start editing your first Jamal-enabled Asciidoc file.

As you edit the file on the left pane, you see the formatted text on the right pane.
It is how the plugin works, but you can also use Jamal macros now.

{%subsection Blogging Macros%}

There are not too many specific macros that differ from other documentation macros.
Most of the macros I use in Jamal are snippet macros and built-in core ones.
Some macros help scan the snippets following the directory naming conventions of the site.
There are some macros to reference one article from another easily.

{%subsection Deploying the Site%}

Deployment of the site is simply a git push.
Almost.
The site has to be built before.
There is a simple build script:


[source,bash]
----
[WARNING]
--
* Cannot read file '../../deploy' from any of the directories:  at /Users/verhasp/github/javax0.github.io/_posts/2022/2022-12-07-blog-posting.adoc.jam/152:11
--
{%@include [verbatim] ../../deploy%}
----

This script builds the site, adds all the new and modified generated files, and then pushes it to the git server.
It also opens the web page, so I can immediately see the blog's opening page after it is deployed.

I tried to let GitHub pages do the building of the Jekyll site.
After all, it supports Jekyll.
The problem is that GitHub does not support the Jekyll Asciidoc plugin.
It is a bit strange: Asciidoc is natively supported by GitHub, and any readme or other files can be Asciidoc.
Still, GitHub Sites cannot be, except if they are built and deployed elsewhere.

{%section Building the site%}

To build the sie the tool gradle is used.
The `build.gradle-kts` file defines custom-made tasks, some of which executes external tools like `jamal` and `jekyll`.
Since Gradle is a JVM tool and the build script is written in Kotlin executed by the JVM, it can use Jamal as a library.
Jekyll, on the other hand, is a Ruby tool, so it is executed by the Gradle task that calls the Ruby interpreter.

.update at 2023-01-25
{%section Building the site (outdated)%}

.

NOTE: This section is out of date as of 2024-04-17 when the site building was refactored to use gradle.
That structure and the tools are described in the previous section.

Building the site was first was a simple `Makefile` starting Jamal via `jbang` to convert all the `.adoc.jam` files to `.adoc` from the directory `_posts`.
This, however, resulted in almost 400 files in the directory.
During the last ten years, I wrote 180 articles.
All their `.adoc.jam` and the generated `.adoc` files got into one flat directory.

To mitigate this situation, I decided to group the articles into subdirectories by years.
It means eleven subdirectories now and 15 to 20 more in my lifetime.
It is manageable.
The problem was I did not know how to write a general `make` rule that says `.adoc.jam` files in the subdirectories should be compiled to `.adoc` files in the `_posts` directory.

I used Jamal to the rescue.
What else?
I created a `Makefile.jam` with the following content:

[source,bash]
----
{@sep [% %] }[%@import tab.jim%]\
all:  [%!@for [evalist] $file in `//` [%@listDir (pattern="\\.adoc\\.jam$") _posts%]`//` =[%@comment%]\
 _posts/[%@file (format=$naked1)$file%]%]\

[%!!#for $dir in ([%@listDir (maxDepth=1 pattern="/\\d{4}$")_posts%])=[%@comment%]\
  [%@ident
    [%@for [evalist] $file in `//` [%@listDir (maxDepth=1 pattern="\\.adoc\\.jam$") $dir%]`//` =[%@comment%]\
    [%#define YYYY=[%#replace (regex)|$dir|.*/_posts/||%]%]\
    [%#define SOURCE=_posts/[%YYYY%]/[%#file (format=$simpleName)$file%]%]\
    [%#define TARGET=_posts/[%@file (format=$naked1)$file%]%]
[%TARGET%] : [%SOURCE%]
[%HT%]jbang jamal@verhas -open='{%%}' -close='%}' [%SOURCE%] [%TARGET%]
    %]%]%]

----

I do not expect you to understand this structure.
It is fairly complex, but it shows the power of Jamal in some ways.
You should not feel intimidated.
If you decide to use Jamal only for 10% of what it can do, it is fine.
It is a tool to provide value and not something you need to master.

This Jamal code lists all the files and generates `Makefile` rules for each `.adoc.jam` article.
I struggled a bit with spaces and tabs.
IntelliJ does not preserve the tabs, except when it is a `Makefile`.
However, `Makefile.jam` is NOT `Makefile`.
As a workaround I created a `tab.jim` file:

[source,bash]
----
{%@include [verbatim] ../../tab.jim%}
----

The comment in the file says it all, I wil not repeat here.

I may later move the `YYYY` yearly subdirectories from `_posts` to make the `_posts` directory something that I never need to open in the editor.
Look at the GitHub repo to see if I did that.

{%section What will be Missing%}

WordPress very neatly showed the statistics of the site.
I do not know if I can get such statistics here.
Probably not.

On the other hand, most of the readers for my articles came from the republishing sites DZone and Java Code Geeks.
I will keep them.
(Note to myself: I have to inform them about the blog's new location officially.)
They automatically fetch the blog posts.
So I do not need to do anything.
They select from the published articles.
They only repost the good ones.

If you know any other aggregator I should contact, give me some advice. I am open.

{%section Summary%}

I hope blogging using this toolset will be much more fun than the old technology.
At least, I am less likely to end up in some articles with `&amp;lt;` and `&amp;gt;` infested source codes.
(I had to apply a unique trick to get them here.)

This type of blogging using Asciidoc, Jekyll, and Jamal is more a Doc as a Code that I advocate heavily.
We will see how it will work.

Java is a complex language, and some features that initially seemed a good idea turned out to be useless.
In this article, we will look at ten such Java language features.

{%section Java Has Labels%}

You can have labels in your Java code.

{%java LABEL%}

Like you could have them in assembly.
Or when you were programming BASIC numbering the lines.

To interrupt an outer loop, you can reference these labels in the `break` or `continue` command.

The output of the above program is:
{%sampleOutput LABEL_OUTPUT.TXT%}

If you want to compare, here is the version without the labels:

[%collapsible, title="Click to open the version without labels"]
====
{%java noLABEL%}

and the output

{%sampleOutput NO_LABEL_OUTPUT.TXT%}
====

{%section You can `break` from a Block%}

Labels make it possible to break from a block.
It does not need to be a loop.

{%java fizbuzz%}

It will print

{%sampleOutput FIZBUZZ.TXT%}

{%section |`static` Methods can also be `final`%}

When a method is final in a class, you cannot redefine it in a child class.
Static methods, however, are not virtual.
They cannot be redefined.
A static method in the child class of the same signature has nothing to do with the method in the parent class.
Or does it?

Actually, it does.
If the static method is `final`, then the child class cannot have a method with the same signature.

To demonstrate this, we compile the test classes dynamically.
We do not want any syntax errors in our demo project.

{%java staticFinalMethod%}

We compile FIZZ and BUZZ.
Both classes have a method named `fizzy()`.
No problem.
Then we change the method in the class `Fizz` to `final`.
Now the compilation fails.

You cannot "override" the final method.

{%section |`goto` is a reserved word%}

There is no `goto` in Java; still, ' goto` is a keyword.
The designers of the language thought it to be a good idea.
Future versions of Java may have a `goto` statement.
Let's reserve this as a keyword.

{%java noGoto%}

If we name the method `_goto`, it is okay.
Using it without an underscore in the front: it is a keyword.
It does not compile.

If you consider that `var`, on the other hand, is NOT a keyword...

{%section |`var` is not a keyword in Java%}

Java 10  introduced `var`.
There are a lot of articles about how you can use `var` and why `var` is not syntactic sugar.
However, `var` is also not a keyword.

If it was a keyword, we could have a program, like

{%java var%}

which was a valid code before Java 10.
It still is because `var` is not a keyword, but it would be ruined if it was.
Luckily, it is not.

You cannot name a class to be `var`.
This means that even though `var` is not a keyword, we may still have some incompatibility.

{%section |Stream operations are mutating%}

It is also a Java secret, but at least this knowledge is not useless.
After all, who would like to read an article full of useless things?
As a matter of fact, there was a question on a Java interview, so it may even be essential to know.

When you chain the stream methods, they transform streams.
There is no operation happening until the final terminal operation is chained up and starts to execute.
The stream operations without the terminal operation only build up the operation chain.
They transform one stream into a new stream.

____
Not only!
____

Stream operations, like `map`, also modify the stream they are attached to.
The stream will remember that an operation was already attached to it and will throw an exception if you try to form a stream.
The following code demonstrates this:

{%java stream%}

The output of this is:

{%sampleOutput STREAM.TXT%}

{%section |Streams do not always run%}

You know that the intermediary operations on a stream do not run if there is no terminal operation.
The terminal operation is the one that runs the streams invoking all the intermediary ones for the elements.
However, not all terminal operations run the whole chain.
It may lead to surprises in some cases.
To see that, let's use `peek()`.

`peek()` is a stream intermediary method that does not modify the stream.
The Javadoc of the method in the official JDK documentation says:

____
This method exists mainly to support debugging, where you want to see the elements as they flow past a certain point in a pipeline.
____

The same Javadoc then gives a sample that uses `System.out.println` to print values from a stream in different stages.
We will do the same

{%java peeking%}

This sample goes through the elements of the stream.
It prints the elements of the stream and then the number of the elements as we have collected them to an `Object[]`:

{%sampleOutput PEEK.txt%}

This is nice and dandy.
What if we do not collect the elements?
In the example above, we are only interested in the number of elements; there is no reason to collect them into an array.

{%java no_peeking%}

We expect to get the same output as before.
The reality, however, is that the output this time is:

{%sampleOutput NO_PEEK.txt%}

Where did the elements go?
Why `peek` does not print the elements?

In this case, the terminal operation `count()` does not execute the stream pipeline.
Therefore, the `peek()` action is not invoked.
There is no magic or secret in it.
The JavaDoc of `count()` explains it.

____
An implementation may choose to not execute the stream pipeline ... if it is capable of computing the count directly from the stream source.
____

In some cases, like the one in the example above, the terminal operation `count()` does not need to iterate through the stream to know the number of elements.
So it does not.

Even the documentation of `peek()` has a link to this fact.
Nobody reads documentation.

{%section |`strictfp` is a modifier%}

Once upon a time, there was a keyword called `strictfp`.
It was introduced in Java 1.2 and required the floating point calculations to be performed differently.
Floating point calculations traditionally used the format IEEE 754 standard defined.
The early x86 processors with the x87 floating point coprocessor worked differently.
The coprocessor used a longer format, allowing more precision.
The `float` and `double` values were 64bit, but the generated code stored the intermediate values on more bits during a calculation.

Before Java 1.2, the compiler generated machine code modifying the result of every intermediate value to 64bit.
This required extra machine code operations and slowed the calculation down.
It was not only slower but more error-prone to overflow errors.
A calculation result could be okay with the 64-bit precision while some intermediate values overflowed.
Using more precision provided by the hardware could lead to the correct value.

`strictfp` was introduced to let the compiler generate a more effective floating-point code.
With 1.2 and later till Java 17, the compiler generates code using the extra precision unless the class or method is `strictfp`.

.just kidding
____
`strictfp` means that the floating calculation will result in the exact wrong result on all platforms.
____

Times change.
Pentium 4 in 2001 allows the compiler to avoid the extra code for strict floating point.
Java could generate the strict floating point effectively.

Java 17 came 20 years later, and Java changed again.
Java 17 later uses strict arithmetic even when `strictfp` is not specified.

You can still use it, and reflectively query its existence on a class, interface, or non-abstract method, but the Java compiler does not use it anymore.
Maybe, the Java compiler was the only one using `strictfp` even in the past.
At least, I have never met anyone who needed that and used it.

{%section There are multiple `ArrayList` implementations in the JDK%}

If you have programmed Java for a long time, you know that you can easily create a list of elements calling `Array.asList()`.
If you look at the implementation of this static method, you can see that it is simply:

[source,java]
----
    @SafeVarargs
    @SuppressWarnings("varargs")
    public static <T> List<T> asList(T... a) {
        return new ArrayList<>(a);
    }
----

in the class `java.util.Arrays`.
Although the method's return type is the interface `List`, the documentation guarantees that the return type is `ArrayList`.
It says

____
Returns a fixed-size list backed by the specified array.
____

So it is an `ArrayList`.
Yes and no.
Let's try the following program:

{%java ArrayListCastError%}

The output will be

{%sampleOutput ARRAYLIST.ERR%}

The returned list is an `ArrayList`, but it is a `java.util.Arrays$ArrayList` and not `java.util.ArrayList`.
These are two different classes and are not compatible.
One cannot be converted to the other; only the simple name is the same.

NOTE: Two classes are the same if their _canonical name_ is the same and were loaded by one class loader.
The simple name being the same is not enough.

Why did the implementors of `asList()` create a new `ArrayList` class?
Probably they wanted to create optimized code.
The list this method returns is backed up by an array just like the `java.util` one.
However, this array cannot be resized.
It is the same array that you provided as an argument.
It is not copied or cloned.
It remains in its place and is used by the list implementation.
You can see that in the following code sample:

{%java backingArray%}

When the code modifies the array, the list also gets modified.
When the list is modified, the array also gets modified.
That is because they are one and the same.

{%section something != something%}

Recently a friend (Istvan Kovács) posted a puzzle on link:https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7022233914991640576/[Linked-in].
What should you write to the place of `???`

{%#replaceLines replace="/Float.NaN/???/"
{%java NaN%}%}

The question was: what should you write into the place of the `???` characters?
Unless you want to have a failing test, you need something which is not equal to itself.

It cannot be an object, because `==` compares the reference "address", therefore an object is always `==` to itself.
It can only be a primitive value.

The solution comes from the link:https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/30711[IEEE 754] standard.
It has the sentence:

____
The exceptions are C predicates “ x == x ” and “ x != x ”, which are respectively 1 and 0 for every
infinite or finite number x but reverse if x is Not a Number ( NaN )
____

Although it talks about the C language, Java has inherited a lot from it.
Java implements the standard as we have already discussed related to the `strictfp` keyword.
That way the code sample is

{%java NaN%}

or
{%#replaceLines replace="/Float.NaN/Double.NaN/"
{%java NaN%}%}


{%section Summary%}

We have visited ten Java features.
These are not important.
Writing about these was fun, and I hope reading them was also fun.
I tried to be precise, and I could not resist including some information that may also be useful despite the article title.

If you know any other more or less useless facts about Java, please write them down in the comments.
